/**
 * Spiral primes
 *
 * Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
 * a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
 *
 * 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
 * 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
 * 39 18  5  4  3 12 29
 * 40 19  6  1  2 11 28
 * 41 20  7  8  9 10 27
 * 42 21 22 23 24 25 26
 * 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
 *
 * It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more
 * interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of
 * 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
 *
 * If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will
 * be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the
 * ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
 *
 * The solution is: 26241
 * (script duration: 30 minutes (before a few tweaks, but now probably still about 20 minutes))
